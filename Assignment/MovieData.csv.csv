Brad Pitt headlines an ensemble cast of eclectic, diverse assassins – all with connected yet conflicting objectives – set against the backdrop of a non-stop ride through modern-day Japan.",David Leitch,"Brad Pitt, Joey King, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry",4729,3.8,"“Bullet Train” is not a good movie, but the fun that radiates off Brad Pitt is magnetic enough to convince you that you're having fun, too...“Bullet Train” may be going nowhere fast, but Pitt always seems like he’s already there, safe in the knowledge that we’ll happily watch him smile through all the chaos that crashes around him.","Unlike so many of the cookie-cutter, wisecracking-assassin movies in recent memory, ""Bullet Train"" acknowledges its outlandishness from the beginning and yet also manages to connect so many dots in creative, gotcha fashion.","Leitch’s talky, violent hit man movie, with Brad Pitt at the center of an over-cranked ensemble cast, reminds us why Hollywood has all but abandoned attempts to copy the successes of Tarantino and Ritchie. This film is not just bloated, tedious, dim-witted, and glib, it’s also redundant...“Bullet Train” aims to be slick when it needs to be smart, and predictable when it should be provocative—effectively making all of the wrong stops at exactly the wrong time.",M18,Action/Thriller,2 hr 7 mins

It wasnt even really about him, and you barley even see him in the movie and the moment you do he doesn't even put up a fight!? They should of made a last epic HALLOWEEN original slasher film that was focused on Laurie and Michael!! With Kills and Scares! I'm soo disappointed, Laurie and Michael deserved an epic ending!","My family and I absolutely loved it! I loved the twist and I am sad to see the franchise end! It definitely wasn't as ""slasher"" as previous movies BUT it was a great end to Halloween... Thank you to the amazing actors we will miss you Michael and Laurie","I’m giving Halloween ends 2 stars only because,  It’s nice seeing Laurie living a normal life. However, the Corey storyline is we’re they lost me. Mike Myers is hardly in this movie. If they didn’t have Corey storyline and had more of a classic Mike Meyers with the ending, it would’ve been the perfect ending to this franchise. I’m glad it’s free on peacock and I didn’t waste $12 to watch it in theaters. I feel bad for Jamie Lee Curtis because, she deserved a better movie.",M18,Horror/Thriller,1 hr 51 mins

Usher, Kyle Gallner, Robin Weigert, Caitlin Stasey",1232,4,"I thought it was a decent movie.  The concept of plot was definitely interesting.  I wouldn’t call this horror, but more suspense…even though it is “paranormal.”   Had opportunity for many jump scares, but kind of just left you waiting for it, with the exception of maybe one or two scenes.

Was nice to take my daughter to a movie and not have overly gory, vulgar language and nudity.",AMAZING JOB!! I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WILL BE A SPIN-OFF OF TRUTH OR DARE- BUT IT IS WAY TOO FAR OFF!!!! ONE OF THE BEST HORROR FILM FOR A WHILE :DDD,"I quite enjoyed this movie .

7,Ticket To Paradise,Now Showing,"
Academy Award® winners George Clooney and Julia Roberts reunite on the big screen as exes who find themselves on a shared mission to stop their lovestruck daughter from making the same mistake they once made. From Working Title, Smokehouse Pictures and Red Om Films, Ticket to Paradise is a romantic comedy about the sweet surprise of second chances.",Ol Parker,"George Clooney, Julia Roberts",8134,3.2,"If you are fed up with all these Netflix comedies lacking of humour having actually push yourself to crack a smile "" Ticket to Padise "" will definitely make things easier for you.

It was a relief to watch a rom com that had fast paced just to the point dialogues. The staring couple was great. Their long last friendship had them feel comfortable with each other so they had a great connection in front of the cameras. Roberts is one of tbe best actresses ever in a variety of genres but romantic comedies will always have her as their Queen!

So if you are looking for a ticket that gets you a couple of hours of joy and relaxation this movie is the answer. Enjoy!","Oof, this is just awful, predictable, by-the-numbers *romantic* comedy. The stars must've done this for the travel and maybe for cash to tip their servants. The trailer tells you everything, and gives you all the very mild laughs. Sure, Julia and George are charming, but they come off as shills here. The daughter is an idiot, and the fiance is flat. There's nothing good here for you. This is empty entertainment, and even in a time where people need fun, this is more like giving a greasy donut to a heart patient. Don't do this to yourself. Ask for better. You deserve it, and Roberts and Clooney owe it to us.","So the last few years the movies weren't that good, but I enjoyed this one, it made me laugh. The actors made me want me to watch it. Also, this generation would definitely enjoy it as they have a habit of rushing things. Besides, I did not get bored nor did I look at my watch. Society and generation play a role. From minute 1 to the end, I can say Clooney and Roberts did a magnificent job. I was also curious about the area and the hotels. I recommend this movie to the current generation. I have not seen women attacking men and things been rushed this fast as much as I saw it with this generation.",PG13,Comedy/Romance,1 hr 44 mins

If we want to see this movie for why those people are big names, then do. By this I mean, they each play the character they have in the story, really well, and this builds as the film goes on and you learn more about them in character. I really enjoyed the acting and craft in this movie. The story is a little long, but smartly unfolds. Often, films that jump around the story do so in ways that add little to the narrative and just confuse. This film does it in a way that adds real substance to the tale and empathy enhancing depth to your connection with the characters. Christian Bale is outstanding again, I really enjoyed this film.","The main 3 characters delivery as they should with a good deal of solid acting, and excellent timed dialogue. The final storyline takes quite a few step-by-steps before it fully develops, and the pace of that may have hurt the ratings. However, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that the surprise part of this movie is the acting of the supporting cast. It is absolutely superb. Each one of them had their own unique character that contributed a good deal to the movie. Their interaction with the main characters was very entertaining. Look beyond the main theme and you will find a fun gem of a movie.","Unfortunately, this movie doesn't live up to its potential. There is too much dialogue and the plot is hard to follow. The weakness is the plot itself. There is simply not enough story to stretch out over the entire runtime.

The cinematography, acting, and set design are top notch and that is why I gave it five stars. Unfortunately, that is not enough to make the movie memorable.

I think the biggest problem, and this is something Hollywood seems to have these days, is that they over dwell on today's problems in historical times, to the point where the most terrifying problems of those times get nearly overlooked.

It's hard to learn from history if we continually rewrite it.",NC16,Crime,2 hr 14 mins
